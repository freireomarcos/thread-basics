# Threading Basics (.NET 8) â€“ Examples and Explanations

This project demonstrates the usage of various threading and synchronization primitives in C#. Each example is implemented in a dedicated class, showing how to coordinate and control access to shared resources in multithreaded scenarios.

## ManualResetEventExample.cs

**Purpose:**  
Demonstrates the use of `ManualResetEvent` for thread synchronization.  
**How it works:**  
- Starts 3 threads, each waiting on a `ManualResetEvent`.
- After a delay, the main thread signals the event, allowing all waiting threads to proceed at once.
- Useful for scenarios where multiple threads need to wait for a single signal.

---

## AutoResetEventExample.cs

**Purpose:**  
Demonstrates the use of `AutoResetEvent` for thread synchronization.  
**How it works:**  
- Starts multiple threads, each waiting on an `AutoResetEvent`.
- The event is signaled one at a time, allowing only one waiting thread to proceed per signal.
- Useful for sequential thread release.

---

## SemaphoreSlimExample.cs

**Purpose:**  
Shows how to use `SemaphoreSlim` to limit concurrent access to a resource.  
**How it works:**  
- Starts 10 threads, each trying to enter a critical section.
- Only a limited number (default: 3) can enter at the same time.
- Threads wait if the limit is reached, and proceed when a slot is released.

---

## SemaphoreExample.cs

**Purpose:**  
Demonstrates the classic `Semaphore` for controlling access to a resource pool.  
**How it works:**  
- Similar to `SemaphoreSlimExample`, but uses the `Semaphore` class.
- 10 threads compete for 3 available slots.
- Each thread waits, enters the critical section, and releases the semaphore when done.

---

## MutexExample.cs

**Purpose:**  
Illustrates the use of `Mutex` for exclusive access to a critical section.  
**How it works:**  
- Starts 5 threads, each waiting to acquire the mutex.
- Only one thread can enter the critical section at a time.
- Ensures mutual exclusion, even across processes (if needed).

---

## LockExample.cs

**Purpose:**  
Shows the use of the `lock` statement (syntactic sugar for `Monitor`) for thread safety.  
**How it works:**  
- 5 threads attempt to enter a critical section protected by a lock.
- Only one thread can execute the locked code at a time.
- Simplifies mutual exclusion within a single process.

---

## MonitorExample.cs

**Purpose:**  
Demonstrates explicit use of `Monitor.Enter` and `Monitor.Exit` for synchronization.  
**How it works:**  
- 5 threads try to enter a critical section guarded by a monitor.
- Manual control over entering and exiting the monitor.
- Useful for advanced scenarios where you need more control than `lock` provides.

---

## WorkSimulator.cs

**Purpose:**  
Utility class to simulate work by sleeping the current thread.  
**How it works:**  
- Provides a static method to pause execution for a specified duration.
- Used in all examples to mimic time-consuming operations.
